    <h3>Q1. What are the different Data types present in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript has 8 data types:-</p>
    <p>String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, Object, Array</p>

    <h3>Q2. What are the JavaScript Engines?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is a scripting language and is not directly understood by computer but the browsers have inbuilt
        JavaScript engine which help them to understand and interpret JavaScript codes. These engines help to convert
        our JavaScript program into computer-understandable language.</p>
    <p>A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript code and converts it into computer
        understandable language.</p>

    <h3>Q3. Explain ECMA in JS.</h3>
    <p>ECMAScript is a standard general-purpose programming language that is conformed by Javascript and some other
        languages. It is the scripting language that formed the basis of browser-based Javascript and Node.js. ECMA is
        an acronym for European Computer Manufacturer's Association, which develops standards for information technology
        and consumer electronics. Languages such as JavaScript, Dart-lang, and C# were standardized by ECMA.</p>

    <h3>Q4. Why we use JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is primarily used for front-end web development, although it
        is also employed in other contexts. Here are some key reasons why JavaScript is widely used:
        Interactive Web Pages, User Interface Enhancement, Server-Side Development</p>

    <h3>Q5. What is JavaScript? And also explain the history of JS.</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for front-end web development. It
        allows developers to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites, making them more engaging and
        user-friendly. JavaScript is a key technology for creating modern, responsive web pages.</p>
    <p>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.

        It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.

        After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the
        Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).</p>

    <h3>Q6. What is DOM in JS.</h3>
    <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove
        elements from the document. We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.</p>
    <p>The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes. A node represents an HTML element.</p>
    <p>Our document is called the root node and contains one child node which is the <html> element. The <html> element
        contains two children which are the

        <head> and

        <body> elements.</p>
    <p>Both the

        <head> and

        <body> elements have children of their own.
    </p>
    <p>We can access these elements in the document and make changes to them using JavaScript.</p>
